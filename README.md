## Computer Systems - Conway's Game of Life

Written by: Tiffany Yu and Ivan Lomelli

This program implements Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) through the use of multi threading. Given a correctly formatted text file, this program plays the Game of Life based on the information provided from the text file. The user must specify the text file they'd like to use and can choose whether they'd like to see each iteration or only the end result, the user also needs to specify the number of threads desired to execute the program.
